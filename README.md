# DAGaml
Abstract manipulations of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using OCaml.

# Why ?
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are present in many fields, for example logic synthesis : logic circuits (such as And-Inverter Graph (AIG)), ROBDD (and GroBdd), even the Disjoint Support Decomposition (DSD) of a multi output function is a DAG.
For more informations about DAGs, I refer you to Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph .
DAGaml provides you a uniformised way of dealing with this structure, in particular : export to Graphviz, serialization and de-serialization.
Feel free to use it and contribute !
If you do so, please send me a message so I can keep track of who is using it and for which purpose.
Also, feel free to send me links to articles/reports that could help design this library.

If you want to help me design this tool but you have no idea how : contact me.

# Installation
you should have installed ocaml (4.04 at least), then clone this repository : git clone https://github.com/JoanThibault/DAGaml.git
