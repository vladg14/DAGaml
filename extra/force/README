  File Description
  ---------------- 
   cnf2hgraph.pl        : Reads file.cnf and creates a hypergraph
                          the output files created are 
                          out.aux, out.nets, out.nodes
			   
   NetPlacer            : Identifies the new CNF variable ordering
                          and outputs the new order to out.pl
			  (Run NetPlacer -h for further options)

   cnf_rename_vars.pl   : Renames the variables in the CNF file 
 		          according to the new variable order.


  Sample Run 
  ----------
   % cnf2hgraph.pl sample.cnf
   % NetPlacer -c 6
   % cnf_rename_vars.pl out.pl sample.cnf sample_new.cnf

   (replace "sample.cnf" by original CNF file name, and 
    "sample_new.cnf" by the new reordered CNF file name)
